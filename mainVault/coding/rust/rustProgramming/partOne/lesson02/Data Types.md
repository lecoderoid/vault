# Data types
## Signed Integer Types
- Rust has several signed int types of knows size:
	- i8
	- i16
	- i32
	- i64
	- i128

---

### Platform-Specific Int Types
- Rust has platform-specific int types:
	- isize
	- usize
- These types are optimized for the natural word size of your platform
	- for max efficiency
---

## Floating-Point Types
- Rust has two floating-points types:
	-  f32 - use f;64 generally, for max precision
	-  f64 - only use f32 if you need to save space
- you can specify the number of decimal places:
``` rust
	let f1: f32 = 1.23456;
	println!("Float to 2dp {:.2}", f1);
```
- you can specify a field width:
``` rust
	println("L-aligned {:<10.2}", f1);
	println("R-aligned {:>10.2}", f1);
```
- you can specify a fill character:
``` rust
	println("L-aligned with tilde {:~<10.2}", f1);
	println("L-aligned with tilde {:~>10.2}", f1);
```
### Using Scientific Notation
- you can use scientific notation for float values:
``` rust
let f3: f32 = -1.60217663e-16;
let f4: f64 = -2.99792458e8;
```
- you can display floats using scientific notation:
``` rust
pritnln!("\nElectron charge {:e}", f3);
```

---
## Boolean Values
- Rust has a bool type, which must be *true* or *false*
```rust
let is_human: bool = true;
let is_flat_earther = false;
```
- you can convert a bool value to 1 or 0
```rust
let is_human_num: i32 = is_human as i32;
let is_flat_earther_num: i32 = is_flat_earther as i32;
```

### Combining Boolean Values
- You can combine Boolean values using these operators:
	- && Logical AND
	- || Logical OR
	- ! Logical NOT
- These are short-circuiting operators
	- as soon as the result is known, subsequent tests are not performed

---
## Character Values
- rust has a *char* type, which supports Unicode characters
- to represent a *char* value, use single quotes:
```rust
let first_letter_of_the_alphabet = 'a';
let my_emoji = 'ðŸ¥²'; 
```
